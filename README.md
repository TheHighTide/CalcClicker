# Calculator Clicker
### About The Game
**Calculator Clicker** is a clicker style game for the TI-83+ calculator. This game is a very barebones clicker game with 3 features:
- Stats Viewing
- Clicking
- And Multiplier Upgrades
This game is still being updated so it will hopefully contain a bunch of new features!

### Development
**Calculator Clicker** is currently being developed by a single person, this person being me (_HighTide_). I am in love with the art of making game for old system and these old yet powerful calculators aren't an exception. This game will be in continued development until version 1.0.0. Currently the game is in version `0.0.1` as of _Friday September 27th 2024_.
